#Why am I interested in ADA?

In these lines I answer the 4 questions, to know me a little and know why it's so important for me to enter ADA:

### Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to progress so far?

> Well, the programming has been always around me, but even when I love maths and my engineering degree is about informatics, I’ve never programmed in my life for real, I think even when algorithms and maths are really easy for my, I didn't find the logic around how developing code works. Maybe because my teachers were more oriented to algorithms solving, mathematics problems and management than developing and execute code.

> But now, after made a deep analysis of the market, I’m sure is the only way to improve my skills, renew my knowledge and maybe in the future use that new skills to find a job. This is a great challenge for me, because I'm new to english, but after a year studying I'm ready to go class.


### What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

> I currently have my own startup, so learning how to code is key for the success of my project and my career, even when I already start with some prototypes i reach 160.000 downloads, and the only way to improve it is learning to code, I think that project will cover the next 2 years. For the next 5 years, i think i will be working on a tech company, using my new skills and i hope still working on my startup, since i think every woman should be independent in what she does and wants.

> I want to make companies look for what I know and am worth, not begging work. I'm a professional with over 7 years experience in technology and computer projects, and I want to prove it.

### Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

> Some time ago, we created a project with a friend and we present it in a fundraising programs for starup. At that time, I thought she was my friend, and certainly she wasn't. We owned the project together, but there was nothing in writing that it could show this. I made two mistakes this time: Trusting people that I vaguely know and leave everything in writing. But certainly, I learned that always, always must be in writing things, even among family and / or friends.

### Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

> I learned to be a team leader and I am proud of it. At school I was class president for several years and then president of the student center. In college, I was also president of the student association. I inspire people trust and believe in me. Now, in my current volunteer, I'm their leader. I think that is something I learn by myself. Certainly, my mother raised me with values, but applying is very different. I'm organized and fair, and hard work closely with the people and put all my passion into my projects. This has helped me in my work, always.
